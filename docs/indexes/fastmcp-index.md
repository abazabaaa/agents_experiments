# FastMCP Documentation Index

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. It provides a secure, standardized way to connect AI systems to context through a client-server architecture, like a "USB-C port for AI applications."

MCP enables AI applications to:
- Access real-time data from external systems
- Execute actions through standardized tools
- Use templated prompts for consistent interactions
- Maintain secure connections with proper authorization
