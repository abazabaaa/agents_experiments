# Grammar Composition

This example shows how to do grammar composition in Lark by creating a new file format that allows both CSV and JSON to co-exist.

1. Define a grammar file storage.lark that imports both csv.lark and json.lark, and allows them to be used one after the other.
   - In the generated tree, each imported rule/terminal is automatically prefixed (with json__ or csv__), which creates an implicit namespace and allows them to coexist without collisions.

2. Merge their respective transformers (unaware of each other) into a new base transformer. The resulting transformer can evaluate both JSON and CSV in the parse tree.
   - The methods of each transformer are renamed into their appropriate namespace, using the given prefix. This approach allows full re-use: the transformers donâ€™t need to care if their grammar is used directly, or being imported, or who is doing the importing.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from lark import Lark
from json import dumps
from lark.visitors import Transformer, merge_transformers

from eval_csv import CsvTreeToPandasDict
from eval_json import JsonTreeToJson

__dir__ = Path(__file__).parent

class Storage(Transformer):
    def start(self, children):
        return children

storage_transformer = merge_transformers(Storage(), csv=CsvTreeToPandasDict(), json=JsonTreeToJson())

parser = Lark.open("storage.lark", rel_to=__file__)

def main():
    json_tree = parser.parse(dumps({"test": "a", "dict": { "list": [1, 1.2] }}))
    res = storage_transformer.transform(json_tree)
    print("Just JSON: ", res)

    csv_json_tree = parser.parse(open(__dir__ / 'combined_csv_and_json.txt').read())
    res = storage_transformer.transform(csv_json_tree)
    print("JSON + CSV: ", dumps(res, indent=2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
