# Tools (Stand-alone, Nearley)

## Stand-alone parser

Lark can generate a stand-alone LALR(1) parser from a grammar. The resulting module provides the same interface as Lark, but with a fixed grammar and reduced functionality.

Run using:

```bash
python -m lark.tools.standalone
```

For a step-by-step guide, read the tutorial:

## Importing grammars from Nearley.js

Lark includes a tool to convert grammars from Nearley (a popular Earley library for JavaScript). It uses Js2Py to convert and run the JavaScript postprocessing code segments.

- Nearley: https://github.com/Hardmath123/nearley
- Js2Py: https://github.com/PiotrDabkowski/Js2Py

### Requirements

1) Install Lark with the nearley component:

```bash
pip install lark[nearley]
```

2) Acquire a copy of the Nearley codebase. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hardmath123/nearley
```

### Usage

Run the converter with:

```bash
python -m lark.tools.nearley <grammar.ne> <start_rule> <path_to_nearley_repo>
```

Example: import Nearleyâ€™s calculator grammar into Lark and write a Python module:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hardmath123/nearley
python -m lark.tools.nearley nearley/examples/calculator/arithmetic.ne main ./nearley > ncalc.py
```

Use the generated module as regular Python:

```python
>>> import ncalc
>>> ncalc.parse('sin(pi/4) ^ e')
0.38981434460254655
```

The converter also supports an experimental ES6+ mode using the --es6 flag:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hardmath123/nearley
python -m lark.tools.nearley nearley/examples/calculator/arithmetic.ne main nearley --es6 > ncalc.py
```

### Notes

- Lark currently cannot import templates from Nearley.
- Lark currently cannot export grammars to Nearley.

These may be added in the future if there is sufficient demand.
