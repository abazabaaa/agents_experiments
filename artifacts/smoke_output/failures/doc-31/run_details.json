It basically looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nrule_name : list of rules and TERMINALS to match\\n          | another possible list of items\\n          | etc.\\n\\nTERMINAL: \\\"some text to match\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n( _a terminal is a string or a regular expression_)\\n\\nThe parser will try to match each rule (left-part) by matching its items (right-part) sequentially, trying each alternative (In practice, the parser is predictive so we don\u2019t have to try every alternative).\\n\\nHow to structure those rules is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but often it\u2019s enough to follow one\u2019s intuition.\\n\\nIn the case of JSON, the structure is simple: A json document is either a list, or a dictionary, or a string/number/etc.\\n\\nThe dictionaries and lists are recursive, and contain other json documents (or \u201cvalues\u201d).\\n\\nLet\u2019s write this structure in EBNF form:\\n\\n```\\n    value: dict\\n         | list\\n         | STRING\\n         | NUMBER\\n         | \\\"true\\\" | \\\"false\\\" | \\\"null\\\"\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : STRING \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n```\\n\\nA quick explanation of the syntax:\\n\\n- Parenthesis let us group rules together.\\n\\n- rule\\\\* means _any amount_. That means, zero or more instances of that rule.\\n\\n- \\\\[rule\\\\] means _optional_. That means zero or one instance of that rule.\\n\\n\\nLark also supports the rule+ operator, meaning one or more instances. It also supports the rule? operator which is another way to say _optional_.\\n\\nOf course, we still haven\u2019t defined \u201cSTRING\u201d and \u201cNUMBER\u201d. Luckily, both these literals are already defined in Lark\u2019s common library:\\n\\n```\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING   -> STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER    -> NUMBER\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe arrow (->) renames the terminals. But that only adds obscurity in this case, so going forward we\u2019ll just use their original names.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll also take care of the white-space, which is part of the text, by simply matching and then throwing it away.\\n\\n```\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe tell our parser to ignore whitespace. Otherwise, we\u2019d have to fill our grammar with WS terminals.\\n\\nBy the way, if you\u2019re curious what these terminals signify, they are roughly equivalent to this:\\n\\n```\\n    NUMBER : /-?\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?([eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?/\\n    STRING : /\\\".*?(?<!\\\\\\\\)\\\"/\\n    %ignore /[ \\\\t\\\\n\\\\f\\\\r]+/\\n\\n```\\n\\nLark will accept this way of writing too, if you really want to complicate your life :)\\n\\nYou can find the original definitions in [common.lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/blob/master/lark/grammars/common.lark).\\nThey don\u2019t strictly adhere to [json.org](https://json.org/) \\\\- but our purpose here is to accept json, not validate it.\\n\\nNotice that terminals are written in UPPER-CASE, while rules are written in lower-case.\\nI\u2019ll touch more on the differences between rules and terminals later.\\n\\n## Part 2 - Creating the Parser [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-2-creating-the-parser \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nOnce we have our grammar, creating the parser is very simple.\\n\\nWe simply instantiate Lark, and tell it to accept a \u201cvalue\u201d:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    value: dict\\n         | list\\n         | ESCAPED_STRING\\n         | SIGNED_NUMBER\\n         | \\\"true\\\" | \\\"false\\\" | \\\"null\\\"\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : ESCAPED_STRING \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nIt\u2019s that simple! Let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14]}'\\n>>> json_parser.parse(text)\\nTree(value, [Tree(dict, [Tree(pair, [Token(STRING, \\\"key\\\"), Tree(value, [Tree(list, [Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(NUMBER, 3.14)])])])])])])\\n>>> print( _.pretty() )\\nvalue\\n  dict\\n    pair\\n      \\\"key\\\"\\n      value\\n        list\\n          value\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n          value\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n          value\\t3.14\\n\\n```\\n\\nAs promised, Lark automagically creates a tree that represents the parsed text.\\n\\nBut something is suspiciously missing from the tree. Where are the curly braces, the commas and all the other punctuation literals?\\n\\nLark automatically filters out literals from the tree, based on the following criteria:\\n\\n- Filter out string literals without a name, or with a name that starts with an underscore.\\n\\n- Keep regexps, even unnamed ones, unless their name starts with an underscore.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this means that it will also filter out literals like \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, and we will lose that information. The next section, \u201cShaping the tree\u201d deals with this issue, and others.\\n\\n## Part 3 - Shaping the Tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-3-shaping-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nWe now have a parser that can create a parse tree (or: AST), but the tree has some issues:\\n\\n1. \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cnull\u201d are filtered out (test it out yourself!)\\n\\n2. Is has useless branches, like _value_, that clutter-up our view.\\n\\n\\nI\u2019ll present the solution, and then explain it:\\n\\n```\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n```\\n\\n1. Those little arrows signify _aliases_. An alias is a name for a specific part of the rule. In this case, we will name the _true/false/null_ matches, and this way we won\u2019t lose the information. We also alias _SIGNED\\\\_NUMBER_ to mark it for later processing.\\n\\n2. The question-mark prefixing _value_ (\u201d?value\u201d) tells the tree-builder to inline this branch if it has only one member. In this case, _value_ will always have only one member, and will always be inlined.\\n\\n3. We turned the _ESCAPED\\\\_STRING_ terminal into a rule. This way it will appear in the tree as a branch. This is equivalent to aliasing (like we did for the number), but now _string_ can also be used elsewhere in the grammar (namely, in the _pair_ rule).\\n\\n\\nHere is the new grammar:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14, true]}'\\n>>> print( json_parser.parse(text).pretty() )\\ndict\\n  pair\\n    string\\t\\\"key\\\"\\n    list\\n      string\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n      string\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n      number\\t3.14\\n      true\\n\\n```\\n\\nAh! That is much much nicer.\\n\\n## Part 4 - Evaluating the tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-4-evaluating-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nIt\u2019s nice to have a tree, but what we really want is a JSON object.\\n\\nThe way to do it is to evaluate the tree, using a Transformer.\\n\\nA transformer is a class with methods corresponding to branch names. For each branch, the appropriate method will be called with the children of the branch as its argument, and its return value will replace the branch in the tree.\\n\\nSo let\u2019s write a partial transformer, that handles lists and dictionaries:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass MyTransformer(Transformer):\\n    def list(self, items):\\n        return list(items)\\n    def pair(self, key_value):\\n        k, v = key_value\\n        return k, v\\n    def dict(self, items):\\n        return dict(items)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it, we get this:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> MyTransformer().transform(tree)\\n{Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"key\\\")]): [Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(number, [Token(ANONRE_0, 3.14)]), Tree(true, [])]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis is pretty close. Let\u2019s write a full transformer that can handle the terminals too.\\n\\nAlso, our definitions of list and dict are a bit verbose. We can do better:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> TreeToJson().transform(tree)\\n{u'key': [u'item0', u'item1', 3.14, True]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nMagic!\\n\\n## Part 5 - Optimizing [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-5-optimizing \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\n### Step 1 - Benchmark [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#step-1-benchmark \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nBy now, we have a fully working JSON parser, that can accept a string of JSON, and return its Pythonic representation.\\n\\nBut how fast is it?\\n\\nNow, of course there are JSON libraries for Python written in C, and we can never compete with them. But since this is applicable to any parser you would write in Lark, let\u2019s see how far we can take this.\\n\\nThe first step for optimizing is to have a benchmark. For this benchmark I\u2019m going to take data from [json-generator.com/](http://www.json-generator.com/). I took their default suggestion and changed it to 5000 objects. The result is a 6.6MB sparse JSON file.\\n\\nOur first program is going to be just a concatenation of everything we\u2019ve done so far:\\n\\n```\\nimport sys\\nfrom lark import Lark, Transformer\\n\\njson_grammar = r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\njson_parser = Lark(json_grammar, start='value', lexer='basic')\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:\\n        tree = json_parser.parse(f.read())\\n        print(TreeToJson().transform(tree))\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe run it and get this:\\n\\n```\\n$ time python tutorial_json.py json_data > /dev/null\\n\\nreal\\t0m36.257s\\nuser\\t0m34.735s\\nsys        0m1.361s\\n\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s unsatisfactory time for a 6MB file.

It basically looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nrule_name : list of rules and TERMINALS to match\\n          | another possible list of items\\n          | etc.\\n\\nTERMINAL: \\\"some text to match\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n( _a terminal is a string or a regular expression_)\\n\\nThe parser will try to match each rule (left-part) by matching its items (right-part) sequentially, trying each alternative (In practice, the parser is predictive so we don\u2019t have to try every alternative).\\n\\nHow to structure those rules is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but often it\u2019s enough to follow one\u2019s intuition.\\n\\nIn the case of JSON, the structure is simple: A json document is either a list, or a dictionary, or a string/number/etc.\\n\\nThe dictionaries and lists are recursive, and contain other json documents (or \u201cvalues\u201d).\\n\\nLet\u2019s write this structure in EBNF form:\\n\\n```\\n    value: dict\\n         | list\\n         | STRING\\n         | NUMBER\\n         | \\\"true\\\" | \\\"false\\\" | \\\"null\\\"\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : STRING \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n```\\n\\nA quick explanation of the syntax:\\n\\n- Parenthesis let us group rules together.\\n\\n- rule\\\\* means _any amount_. That means, zero or more instances of that rule.\\n\\n- \\\\[rule\\\\] means _optional_. That means zero or one instance of that rule.\\n\\n\\nLark also supports the rule+ operator, meaning one or more instances. It also supports the rule? operator which is another way to say _optional_.\\n\\nOf course, we still haven\u2019t defined \u201cSTRING\u201d and \u201cNUMBER\u201d. Luckily, both these literals are already defined in Lark\u2019s common library:\\n\\n```\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING   -> STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER    -> NUMBER\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe arrow (->) renames the terminals. But that only adds obscurity in this case, so going forward we\u2019ll just use their original names.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll also take care of the white-space, which is part of the text, by simply matching and then throwing it away.\\n\\n```\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe tell our parser to ignore whitespace. Otherwise, we\u2019d have to fill our grammar with WS terminals.\\n\\nBy the way, if you\u2019re curious what these terminals signify, they are roughly equivalent to this:\\n\\n```\\n    NUMBER : /-?\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?([eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?/\\n    STRING : /\\\".*?(?<!\\\\\\\\)\\\"/\\n    %ignore /[ \\\\t\\\\n\\\\f\\\\r]+/\\n\\n```\\n\\nLark will accept this way of writing too, if you really want to complicate your life :)\\n\\nYou can find the original definitions in [common.lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/blob/master/lark/grammars/common.lark).\\nThey don\u2019t strictly adhere to [json.org](https://json.org/) \\\\- but our purpose here is to accept json, not validate it.\\n\\nNotice that terminals are written in UPPER-CASE, while rules are written in lower-case.\\nI\u2019ll touch more on the differences between rules and terminals later.\\n\\n## Part 2 - Creating the Parser [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-2-creating-the-parser \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nOnce we have our grammar, creating the parser is very simple.\\n\\nWe simply instantiate Lark, and tell it to accept a \u201cvalue\u201d:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    value: dict\\n         | list\\n         | ESCAPED_STRING\\n         | SIGNED_NUMBER\\n         | \\\"true\\\" | \\\"false\\\" | \\\"null\\\"\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : ESCAPED_STRING \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nIt\u2019s that simple! Let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14]}'\\n>>> json_parser.parse(text)\\nTree(value, [Tree(dict, [Tree(pair, [Token(STRING, \\\"key\\\"), Tree(value, [Tree(list, [Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(NUMBER, 3.14)])])])])])])\\n>>> print( _.pretty() )\\nvalue\\n  dict\\n    pair\\n      \\\"key\\\"\\n      value\\n        list\\n          value\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n          value\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n          value\\t3.14\\n\\n```\\n\\nAs promised, Lark automagically creates a tree that represents the parsed text.\\n\\nBut something is suspiciously missing from the tree. Where are the curly braces, the commas and all the other punctuation literals?\\n\\nLark automatically filters out literals from the tree, based on the following criteria:\\n\\n- Filter out string literals without a name, or with a name that starts with an underscore.\\n\\n- Keep regexps, even unnamed ones, unless their name starts with an underscore.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this means that it will also filter out literals like \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, and we will lose that information. The next section, \u201cShaping the tree\u201d deals with this issue, and others.\\n\\n## Part 3 - Shaping the Tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-3-shaping-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nWe now have a parser that can create a parse tree (or: AST), but the tree has some issues:\\n\\n1. \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cnull\u201d are filtered out (test it out yourself!)\\n\\n2. Is has useless branches, like _value_, that clutter-up our view.\\n\\n\\nI\u2019ll present the solution, and then explain it:\\n\\n```\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n```\\n\\n1. Those little arrows signify _aliases_. An alias is a name for a specific part of the rule. In this case, we will name the _true/false/null_ matches, and this way we won\u2019t lose the information. We also alias _SIGNED\\\\_NUMBER_ to mark it for later processing.\\n\\n2. The question-mark prefixing _value_ (\u201d?value\u201d) tells the tree-builder to inline this branch if it has only one member. In this case, _value_ will always have only one member, and will always be inlined.\\n\\n3. We turned the _ESCAPED\\\\_STRING_ terminal into a rule. This way it will appear in the tree as a branch. This is equivalent to aliasing (like we did for the number), but now _string_ can also be used elsewhere in the grammar (namely, in the _pair_ rule).\\n\\n\\nHere is the new grammar:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14, true]}'\\n>>> print( json_parser.parse(text).pretty() )\\ndict\\n  pair\\n    string\\t\\\"key\\\"\\n    list\\n      string\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n      string\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n      number\\t3.14\\n      true\\n\\n```\\n\\nAh! That is much much nicer.\\n\\n## Part 4 - Evaluating the tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-4-evaluating-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nIt\u2019s nice to have a tree, but what we really want is a JSON object.\\n\\nThe way to do it is to evaluate the tree, using a Transformer.\\n\\nA transformer is a class with methods corresponding to branch names. For each branch, the appropriate method will be called with the children of the branch as its argument, and its return value will replace the branch in the tree.\\n\\nSo let\u2019s write a partial transformer, that handles lists and dictionaries:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass MyTransformer(Transformer):\\n    def list(self, items):\\n        return list(items)\\n    def pair(self, key_value):\\n        k, v = key_value\\n        return k, v\\n    def dict(self, items):\\n        return dict(items)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it, we get this:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> MyTransformer().transform(tree)\\n{Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"key\\\")]): [Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(number, [Token(ANONRE_0, 3.14)]), Tree(true, [])]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis is pretty close. Let\u2019s write a full transformer that can handle the terminals too.\\n\\nAlso, our definitions of list and dict are a bit verbose. We can do better:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> TreeToJson().transform(tree)\\n{u'key': [u'item0', u'item1', 3.14, True]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nMagic!\\n\\n## Part 5 - Optimizing [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-5-optimizing \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\n### Step 1 - Benchmark [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#step-1-benchmark \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nBy now, we have a fully working JSON parser, that can accept a string of JSON, and return its Pythonic representation.\\n\\nBut how fast is it?\\n\\nNow, of course there are JSON libraries for Python written in C, and we can never compete with them. But since this is applicable to any parser you would write in Lark, let\u2019s see how far we can take this.\\n\\nThe first step for optimizing is to have a benchmark. For this benchmark I\u2019m going to take data from [json-generator.com/](http://www.json-generator.com/). I took their default suggestion and changed it to 5000 objects. The result is a 6.6MB sparse JSON file.\\n\\nOur first program is going to be just a concatenation of everything we\u2019ve done so far:\\n\\n```\\nimport sys\\nfrom lark import Lark, Transformer\\n\\njson_grammar = r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\njson_parser = Lark(json_grammar, start='value', lexer='basic')\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:\\n        tree = json_parser.parse(f.read())\\n        print(TreeToJson().transform(tree))\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe run it and get this:\\n\\n```\\n$ time python tutorial_json.py json_data > /dev/null\\n\\nreal\\t0m36.257s\\nuser\\t0m34.735s\\nsys        0m1.361s\\n\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s unsatisfactory time for a 6MB file.

Otherwise, we\u2019d have to fill our grammar with WS terminals.\\n\\nBy the way, if you\u2019re curious what these terminals signify, they are roughly equivalent to this:\\n\\n```\\n    NUMBER : /-?\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?([eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?/\\n    STRING : /\\\".*?(?<!\\\\\\\\)\\\"/\\n    %ignore /[ \\\\t\\\\n\\\\f\\\\r]+/\\n\\n```\\n\\nLark will accept this way of writing too, if you really want to complicate your life :)\\n\\nYou can find the original definitions in [common.lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/blob/master/lark/grammars/common.lark).\\nThey don\u2019t strictly adhere to [json.org](https://json.org/) \\\\- but our purpose here is to accept json, not validate it.\\n\\nNotice that terminals are written in UPPER-CASE, while rules are written in lower-case.\\nI\u2019ll touch more on the differences between rules and terminals later.\\n\\n## Part 2 - Creating the Parser [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-2-creating-the-parser \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nOnce we have our grammar, creating the parser is very simple.\\n\\nWe simply instantiate Lark, and tell it to accept a \u201cvalue\u201d:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    value: dict\\n         | list\\n         | ESCAPED_STRING\\n         | SIGNED_NUMBER\\n         | \\\"true\\\" | \\\"false\\\" | \\\"null\\\"\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : ESCAPED_STRING \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nIt\u2019s that simple! Let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14]}'\\n>>> json_parser.parse(text)\\nTree(value, [Tree(dict, [Tree(pair, [Token(STRING, \\\"key\\\"), Tree(value, [Tree(list, [Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(STRING, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(value, [Token(NUMBER, 3.14)])])])])])])\\n>>> print( _.pretty() )\\nvalue\\n  dict\\n    pair\\n      \\\"key\\\"\\n      value\\n        list\\n          value\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n          value\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n          value\\t3.14\\n\\n```\\n\\nAs promised, Lark automagically creates a tree that represents the parsed text.\\n\\nBut something is suspiciously missing from the tree. Where are the curly braces, the commas and all the other punctuation literals?\\n\\nLark automatically filters out literals from the tree, based on the following criteria:\\n\\n- Filter out string literals without a name, or with a name that starts with an underscore.\\n\\n- Keep regexps, even unnamed ones, unless their name starts with an underscore.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this means that it will also filter out literals like \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d, and we will lose that information. The next section, \u201cShaping the tree\u201d deals with this issue, and others.\\n\\n## Part 3 - Shaping the Tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-3-shaping-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nWe now have a parser that can create a parse tree (or: AST), but the tree has some issues:\\n\\n1. \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cnull\u201d are filtered out (test it out yourself!)\\n\\n2. Is has useless branches, like _value_, that clutter-up our view.\\n\\n\\nI\u2019ll present the solution, and then explain it:\\n\\n```\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n```\\n\\n1. Those little arrows signify _aliases_. An alias is a name for a specific part of the rule. In this case, we will name the _true/false/null_ matches, and this way we won\u2019t lose the information. We also alias _SIGNED\\\\_NUMBER_ to mark it for later processing.\\n\\n2. The question-mark prefixing _value_ (\u201d?value\u201d) tells the tree-builder to inline this branch if it has only one member. In this case, _value_ will always have only one member, and will always be inlined.\\n\\n3. We turned the _ESCAPED\\\\_STRING_ terminal into a rule. This way it will appear in the tree as a branch. This is equivalent to aliasing (like we did for the number), but now _string_ can also be used elsewhere in the grammar (namely, in the _pair_ rule).\\n\\n\\nHere is the new grammar:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Lark\\njson_parser = Lark(r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\", start='value')\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd let\u2019s test it out:\\n\\n```\\n>>> text = '{\\\"key\\\": [\\\"item0\\\", \\\"item1\\\", 3.14, true]}'\\n>>> print( json_parser.parse(text).pretty() )\\ndict\\n  pair\\n    string\\t\\\"key\\\"\\n    list\\n      string\\t\\\"item0\\\"\\n      string\\t\\\"item1\\\"\\n      number\\t3.14\\n      true\\n\\n```\\n\\nAh! That is much much nicer.\\n\\n## Part 4 - Evaluating the tree [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-4-evaluating-the-tree \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nIt\u2019s nice to have a tree, but what we really want is a JSON object.\\n\\nThe way to do it is to evaluate the tree, using a Transformer.\\n\\nA transformer is a class with methods corresponding to branch names. For each branch, the appropriate method will be called with the children of the branch as its argument, and its return value will replace the branch in the tree.\\n\\nSo let\u2019s write a partial transformer, that handles lists and dictionaries:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass MyTransformer(Transformer):\\n    def list(self, items):\\n        return list(items)\\n    def pair(self, key_value):\\n        k, v = key_value\\n        return k, v\\n    def dict(self, items):\\n        return dict(items)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it, we get this:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> MyTransformer().transform(tree)\\n{Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"key\\\")]): [Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item0\\\")]), Tree(string, [Token(ANONRE_1, \\\"item1\\\")]), Tree(number, [Token(ANONRE_0, 3.14)]), Tree(true, [])]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis is pretty close. Let\u2019s write a full transformer that can handle the terminals too.\\n\\nAlso, our definitions of list and dict are a bit verbose. We can do better:\\n\\n```\\nfrom lark import Transformer\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd when we run it:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tree = json_parser.parse(text)\\n>>> TreeToJson().transform(tree)\\n{u'key': [u'item0', u'item1', 3.14, True]}\\n\\n```\\n\\nMagic!\\n\\n## Part 5 - Optimizing [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#part-5-optimizing \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\n### Step 1 - Benchmark [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#step-1-benchmark \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nBy now, we have a fully working JSON parser, that can accept a string of JSON, and return its Pythonic representation.\\n\\nBut how fast is it?\\n\\nNow, of course there are JSON libraries for Python written in C, and we can never compete with them. But since this is applicable to any parser you would write in Lark, let\u2019s see how far we can take this.\\n\\nThe first step for optimizing is to have a benchmark. For this benchmark I\u2019m going to take data from [json-generator.com/](http://www.json-generator.com/). I took their default suggestion and changed it to 5000 objects. The result is a 6.6MB sparse JSON file.\\n\\nOur first program is going to be just a concatenation of everything we\u2019ve done so far:\\n\\n```\\nimport sys\\nfrom lark import Lark, Transformer\\n\\njson_grammar = r\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ?value: dict\\n          | list\\n          | string\\n          | SIGNED_NUMBER      -> number\\n          | \\\"true\\\"             -> true\\n          | \\\"false\\\"            -> false\\n          | \\\"null\\\"             -> null\\n\\n    list : \\\"[\\\" [value (\\\",\\\" value)*] \\\"]\\\"\\n\\n    dict : \\\"{\\\" [pair (\\\",\\\" pair)*] \\\"}\\\"\\n    pair : string \\\":\\\" value\\n\\n    string : ESCAPED_STRING\\n\\n    %import common.ESCAPED_STRING\\n    %import common.SIGNED_NUMBER\\n    %import common.WS\\n    %ignore WS\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nclass TreeToJson(Transformer):\\n    def string(self, s):\\n        (s,) = s\\n        return s[1:-1]\\n    def number(self, n):\\n        (n,) = n\\n        return float(n)\\n\\n    list = list\\n    pair = tuple\\n    dict = dict\\n\\n    null = lambda self, _: None\\n    true = lambda self, _: True\\n    false = lambda self, _: False\\n\\njson_parser = Lark(json_grammar, start='value', lexer='basic')\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:\\n        tree = json_parser.parse(f.read())\\n        print(TreeToJson().transform(tree))\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe run it and get this:\\n\\n```\\n$ time python tutorial_json.py json_data > /dev/null\\n\\nreal\\t0m36.257s\\nuser\\t0m34.735s\\nsys        0m1.361s\\n\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s unsatisfactory time for a 6MB file. Maybe if we were parsing configuration or a small DSL, but we\u2019re trying to handle large amount of data here.\\n\\nWell, turns out there\u2019s quite a bit we can do about it!\\n\\n### Step 2 - LALR(1) [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#step-2-lalr-1 \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nSo far we\u2019ve been using the Earley algorithm, which is the default in Lark. Earley is powerful but slow. But it just so happens that our grammar is LR-compatible, and specifically LALR(1) compatible.\\n\\nSo let\u2019s switch to LALR(1) and see what happens:\\n\\n```\\njson_parser = Lark(json_grammar, start='value', parser='lalr')\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n$ time python tutorial_json.py json_data > /dev/null\\n\\nreal        0m7.554s\\nuser        0m7.352s\\nsys         0m0.148s\\n\\n```\\n\\nAh, that\u2019s much better. The resulting JSON is of course exactly the same. You can run it for yourself and see.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all grammars are LR-compatible, and so you can\u2019t always switch to LALR(1). But there\u2019s no harm in trying! If Lark lets you build the grammar, it means you\u2019re good to go.\\n\\n### Step 3 - Tree-less LALR(1) [\uf0c1](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/json_tutorial.html\\\\#step-3-tree-less-lalr-1 \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nSo far, we\u2019ve built a full",
